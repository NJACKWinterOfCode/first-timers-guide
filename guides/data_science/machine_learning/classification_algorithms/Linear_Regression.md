# Linear Regression

[**Simple Linear Regression**][1] is useful for finding relationship between two continuous variables. One is predictor or independent variable and other is response or dependent variable. It looks for statistical relationship but not deterministic relationship. Relationship between two variables is said to be deterministic if one variable can be accurately expressed by the other. That's why it falls under the group of the classification algorithm.

## how it works...

Linear Regression measures the relationship between the dependent variable (**label**) and the one or more independent variables (**features**), by estimating probabilities using its underlying linear function vis-a-vis cost function.

## when to use it...

Linear Regression provides a discrete outcome. When we have a data of a large number of two variable and they seems to follow a straight line, we genearally prefer to predict the outcome by using Linear Regression. For example, if we have data about size of a house and its price, we would plot a graph between price vs size. The data might appear to follow a straight line. The best way to predict the price of the house with the help os size of the house, is to plot a straight line that best fits the point.
